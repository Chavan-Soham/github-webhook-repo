# github-webhook-repo
This contains code of webhooks

I am using ngrok to expose local web servers to the internet, making them accessible through a public URL so that I can use this URL in the Webhook payload URL settings of Github setting of **action-repo** repo.

I have named the database as "github-actions". I started the mongo db server using **mongod** command. This is how the data gets stored in the database:

I am using a dummy folder called **output text file** with text files to push into action-repo and test the code. This was my last test for merge:

I executed command python app.py and then executed the command ngrok http 5000:

This is simple UI using Bootstrap displaying the latest events with author, branches names and to/from and with timestamp UTC.

I have attached my CV and assessment details in the google form link such as action-repo and webhook-repo links.
